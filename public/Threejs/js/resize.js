/*These mehtods will be used to scale clothing and orientation for 
each new model created. Because the clothing is custom made in Blender,
anyone reading the source code will see alot of hard-coded values. This
is becasue we made the clothing based on "base models". We custom fit the clothing
accordingly and then scale the clothing as neccessary.*/
